!!Make sure you have python!!


First make sure you have all the proper libraries installed

python3 -m pip install discord huggingface_hub dotenv requests

Then get the .env file and the corresponding tokens (Obtain from us or get a separate discord_api_token, google_safe_browsing_token, and huggingface token)
- Make sure .env file is in same folder as code (Make sure file is named .env)

Then you can run the bot locally:

cd into the correct folder to where the test_bot.py file is located.

Use '''python3 test_bot.py''' to run the file


General Steps:
---------------

1. get code from github
2. get tokens in .env
3. run test_bot
